# Healthcare App: Object-Oriented Software Engineering Project

## Overview

The *Healthcare App* is an innovative platform designed to connect patients with healthcare professionals (HCPs), streamline medical assistance, and foster a collaborative environment for knowledge sharing among healthcare professionals. Developed with a user-friendly interface, this app is built to enhance the healthcare experience by providing easy access to medical records, appointment management, and a repository of medical publications for HCPs.

## Features

- **Patient and HCP Profiles**: Allows patients and HCPs to create and manage profiles, ensuring secure access to medical history and records.
- **Appointment Management**: Simplifies the scheduling, booking, and tracking of appointments between patients and healthcare providers.
- **Medical Record Access**: Enables patients to securely access their health data, facilitating informed decision-making.
- **Knowledge Repository**: Provides HCPs with access to medical papers and publications, supporting evidence-based practices and professional development.
- **Data Visualization Dashboard**: A Power BI dashboard integrated with MongoDB and SQL, designed to prioritize and manage patient information for efficient healthcare delivery.
  
## Technology Stack

- **Database**: MongoDB and SQL for robust, secure data storage and retrieval.
- **Power BI**: Interactive data visualizations to support real-time decision-making and prioritization.
- **Mobile Development**: Designed for both Android and iOS platforms using object-oriented principles.
- **UML**: Unified Modeling Language (UML) for system modeling, providing a clear structure for developers.

## Methodology

The project employs a structured approach:

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Identifying functional and non-functional requirements from key stakeholders.
2. **System Analysis**: Developing UML models and use cases to visualize interactions and workflows within the app.
3. **Design and Development**: Building a detailed architecture and implementing functionalities as per the design specifications.
4. **Testing**: Conducting rigorous user acceptance testing (UAT) with clinical staff to ensure functionality, performance, and security.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces time and effort needed for managing patient data and appointments.
- **Enhanced Usability**: Achieved a 90% satisfaction rate in UAT, with healthcare staff affirming the dashboardâ€™s usability.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Fosters collaboration among healthcare professionals through a repository of the latest medical research.

## Future Enhancements

Potential upgrades may include telemedicine capabilities, AI-driven health recommendations, and advanced data analytics for personalized healthcare services.
